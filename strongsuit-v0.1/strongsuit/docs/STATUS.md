# STATUS — read this first

**Last updated:** 2026-08-14 (S21, Claude Sonnet 5)
**Health:** 50 test files · 735 tests green · `npx tsc -b --force` clean (0 errors) · `sync-server` typechecks clean

> ⚠️ **The `tsc` command above is not a typo — read `AGENTS.md` §4 before you trust any prior "clean
> typecheck" claim, including ones in older session files.** The root `tsc --noEmit` invocation silently
> checks zero files (solution-file config quirk). S21 discovered this the hard way: running the *correct*
> command (`tsc -b --force`) surfaced **265 real, previously-invisible compile errors** — a corrupted i18n
> catalogue, a component with unreachable dead code, several variable-shadowing bugs, calls to methods
> that don't exist. All fixed and verified live in-browser this session. Every "clean" claim in S15–S20
> below was made in good faith against the broken command; none of them were lying, the command was.

## Baton — what the last session left

| | |
|---|---|
| **Last worked on** | S21: found and fixed the `tsc --noEmit` false-negative (see banner above) and everything it had been hiding. Also live-verified S16–S20's real work (exercise library import, seed versioning, food logging, roster summary, branding gate) in-browser — it's all genuinely working now. |
| **Safe to pick up** | Anything in `ROADMAP.md`. Tree is clean, tests green, typecheck **actually** clean this time. |
| **Half-done / in flight** | Nothing mid-edit. |
| **Don't touch without reading first** | `AGENTS.md` §4's `tsc -b` note — this changes the session-start/session-end commands for every tool, permanently. Also see DEBT-68/69 below, both small and freshly found, not yet acted on. |
| **Blocked on Caleb (no AI can do these)** | Real Stripe keys · deploy the relay domain · run the Windows installer on real hardware · a Mac to build on · real-phone Film Room footage |

## What the product is (one paragraph)

A local-first coaching workstation for personal trainers. Every client, program, and session lives in
IndexedDB on the coach's own machine — no account required, works fully offline. **Free tier: up to 3
clients. Coachwright Membership: $29/mo, unlimited.** Optional E2EE sync relay (self-hosted free, or
managed $15/mo) is the only thing that ever touches a network, and it only ever sees ciphertext.
Companion is a separate free client-facing PWA. See `PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md` for positioning.

## What genuinely works, verified live this session

- **Core coaching loop** — roster, program builder (keyboard-first, undo/redo, dnd), session logger,
  progression engine, exercise history, analytics, reports.
- **Exercise library — 1,099 entries**, verified by direct IndexedDB count on a fresh boot. Grew from 277
  via Engine A (Free Exercise DB import, S16). **Seed-update mechanism (DEBT-67) works correctly** — S21
  simplified S17's original version, which had a real latent flaw: it diffed stored content against
  *incoming* seed content to guess "did the coach edit this," which would have silently frozen any
  legitimate future content update behind a phantom override for every coach who never touched that row.
  A coach edit never lands in the base `exercises` table in the first place (`exercisesRepo.update()`
  always routes it into the separate `exerciseOverrides` table), so the migration can now safely
  overwrite stock rows unconditionally on a version bump. Two new/rewritten tests in `db/boot.test.ts`
  cover both the real coach-edit path and this exact regression.
- **Food logging (S18)** — barcode scanning (`BarcodeDetector` API + `zxing-wasm` fallback, no CDN
  scripts), Open Food Facts lookup gated behind `cloudCapabilities().barcodeLookup` (off in fully-local
  mode, on otherwise — verified live: correct "fully-local mode" message with no network call attempted).
  **S21 fixed a real bug**: the camera scan loop checked a stale closure of React state and would never
  actually have detected a barcode (fixed with a ref instead); also fixed calls to repo methods that
  never existed (`.add()`/`.delete()` → `.create()`/`.remove()`) and a `rationale.protein.target`
  reference that doesn't exist on that type (→ `plan.proteinG` etc.).
- **Roster check-in digest (S19)** — grounded LLM summary of the week's check-ins. **S21 added a missing
  gate**: it previously called the same model pipeline the Assistant page uses with no
  installed-model check, so clicking "Generate" from the Dashboard without ever visiting Settings would
  have silently started a ~1.1GB background download behind a spinner that just said "thinking." Verified
  live: now shows "Needs the local Assistant model... install it in Settings first" with an Install-model
  link instead.
- **Branding gating (S20)** — custom branding (logo, color, business name in exports) correctly gated
  behind Membership for new installs, with existing installs grandfathered by `createdAt`. Verified live
  in onboarding.
- **Film Room** — dual-clip video comparison, frame-step, sync-lock w/ drift correction, line/angle
  tools, and on-device MediaPipe pose tracking (reps, tempo, depth, symmetry, bar path) including true
  *simultaneous* two-clip tracking with a comparison breakdown.
- **Science engines** — nutrition (Mifflin-St Jeor + cited macros, carb cycling, diet-break), readiness
  v2, cycle tracking, energy availability. All pure + unit-tested.
- **Business** — Profit Planner, expenses, ledger, invoicing w/ coupons, gym cut, staff commissions.
- **Studio/team** — staff, locations, leads CRM, leaderboards, TV mode.
- **Sync** — E2EE device pairing (ECDH + AES-GCM + spoken safety number), three transports (relay /
  LAN / file) through one merge path. Messaging + poll-based reminders. **S21 fixed a real, previously
  undetected bug**: `WiFiSyncDialog.tsx` had a module-scope IPC handler referencing component-local
  variables (`api`, `t`) and unimported functions (`applyPacket`, `buildPacket`) — dead code that could
  never have run, and a `port` variable used in the QR-code URL that was never declared anywhere. Both
  fixed (handler moved into a proper `useEffect`, `port` now comes from the server's own response).
- **i18n** — RTL + the translation layer are real and, as of S21, actually type-checked for the first
  time (a 100+-line nested-object block that broke the *entire* catalogue's type system silently — see
  banner above — is now flattened to match the rest of the file).
- **Local AI, 4 kinds wired** — semantic exercise search, voice set logging (Whisper), the grounded
  assistant (Qwen3 + Film Room context), OCR log-sheet scanning (Tesseract). Each proven against a real
  model before app code was written.
- **Membership billing** — Stripe Checkout + webhook + billing portal + offline-verified signed tokens.
  Cross-checked end-to-end (server-minted token verified by the app's own verifier).
- **Companion PWA** — standalone logging, assigned programs, messaging, Film Room self-review, 146 tests.
- **Desktop** — Electron shell, native menu, window-state persistence, splash. One real GUI launch done.

## What is thin, stubbed, or unverified — the honest list

| Thing | Reality |
|---|---|
| **Local AI registry** | 12 entries, **5 unwired** (`multilingual-e5-small`, `whisper-small`, `qwen3-4b`, `qwen3-8b`, `rtmpose-m`) and visibly tagged "not downloadable yet" in the UI. |
| **Membership billing** | Code complete + verified, but **cannot take a single real dollar today** — no live Stripe keys, and `MEMBERSHIP_SERVER_URL` points at an undeployed placeholder domain. |
| **i18n string conversion** | Layer + RTL + (now) real type-checking all work. Conversion coverage itself unmeasured this session — recheck the "~53 of 57 components hardcoded" figure, it predates S16–S21's changes. |
| **Client portability** | Excludes `foodEntries` (DEBT-68, same shape as the already-documented DEBT-26 for invoices/expenses). |
| **CommandPalette** | No "Ask the Assistant" quick-search entry (DEBT-69) — the route and page are fine, still reachable from a client's detail page, just not from ⌘K. |
| **Film Room accuracy** | Rep-counter thresholds tuned against *synthetic* data only. Never run on real human footage or a real mid-range phone. |
| **Mac** | Never attempted. No Mac in any build environment so far. |
| **Android** | Real Capacitor project generated, **never compiled or run**. |
| **Windows installer** | Builds, never run on real hardware. |
| **Mobile responsive** | Verified: Dashboard, Clients, Programs, Builder. **Unverified:** Film Room dual-video, Calendar, Business/Billing, Settings. |
| **Lighthouse / cross-browser** | Never run — one browser engine available, no Lighthouse CLI. |
| **Free-tier cap** | Enforced locally and honestly, not unbreakably. Fine by design, but it now guards revenue, not just cosmetics. |

## Commands

```bash
npx vitest run          # 735 tests, ~3-4min
npx tsc -b --force      # app typecheck — NOT `tsc --noEmit`, see banner at top of this file
npm run dev             # vite dev server (port 5173/5174)
npm run dev:electron    # desktop shell — ALWAYS confirm the process died after
```

Before any Electron build: `Get-Process node,electron -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` — orphaned
processes cause `EPERM` failures that look like antivirus. This burned a full session once.
